Foucault returned to France in 1960 to complete his doctorate and take up a post in philosophy at the University of Clermont-Ferrand .
Foucault 's Les Mots et les choses .
In the Autumn of 1968 he returned to France , where he published L'archÃ©ologie du savoir -LRB- The Archaeology of Knowledge -RRB- â a methodological response to his critics â in 1969 .
In the aftermath of 1968 , the French government created a new experimental university , Paris VIII , at Vincennes and appointed Foucault the first head of its philosophy department in December of that year .
Its first volume was published in French as La VolontÃ© de Savoir -LRB- 1976 -RRB- , then in English as The History of Sexuality : An Introduction -LRB- 1978 -RRB- .
Foucault died of an AIDS -related illness in Paris on 25 June , 1984 .
Prior to his death , Foucault had destroyed most of his manuscripts and in his will prohibited the publication of what he might have overlooked .
Works
Madness and Civilization
This was Foucault 's first major book , mostly written while he was the Director of the Maison de France in Sweden .
It examines ideas , practices , institutions , art and literature relating to madness in Western history .
Foucault begins his history in the Middle Ages , noting the social and physical exclusion of lepers .
He argues that with the gradual disappearance of leprosy , madness came to occupy this excluded position .
In the eighteenth century , madness came to be seen as the reverse of Reason , and , finally , in the nineteenth century as mental illness .
He examines the rise of scientific and `` humanitarian '' treatments of the insane , notably at the hands of Philippe Pinel and Samuel Tuke who he suggests started the conceptualization of madness as ` mental illness ' .
He claims that these new treatments were in fact no less controlling than previous method .
Pinel 's treatment of the mad amounted to an extended aversion therapy , including such treatments as freezing showers and use of a straitjacket .
The Birth of the Clinic
Foucault 's second major book , The Birth of the Clinic : An Archaeology of Medical Perception -LRB- Naissance de la clinique : une archÃ©ologie du regard mÃ©dical -RRB- was published in 1963 in France , and translated to English in 1973 .
Picking up from Madness and Civilization , The Birth of the Clinic traces the development of the medical profession , and specifically the institution of the clinique -LRB- translated as `` clinic '' , but here largely referring to teaching hospitals -RRB- .
The Order of Things
Foucault 's Les Mots et les choses .
Une archÃ©ologie des sciences humaines was published in 1966 .
The book opens with an extended discussion of Diego VelÃ¡zquez ` s painting Las Meninas and its complex arrangement of sight-lines , hiddenness and appearance .
The book made Foucault a prominent intellectual figure in France .
He strives to avoid all interpretation and to depart from the goals of hermeneutics .
The Archaeology of Knowledge
Foucault later distanced himself from structuralism .
Discipline and Punish
Foucault also compares modern society with Jeremy Bentham ` s `` Panopticon `` design for prisons -LRB- which was unrealized in its original form , but nonetheless influential -RRB- : in the Panopticon , a single guard can watch over many prisoners while the guard remains unseen .
The History of Sexuality
Three volumes of The History of Sexuality were published before Foucault 's death in 1984 .
The fourth volume was to be entitled Confessions of the Flesh -LRB- Les aveux de la chair -RRB- .
Further reading
Foucault joined the French Communist Party from 1950 to 1953 .

The Velabrum is the low valley in the city of Rome that connects the Forum with the Forum Boarium , and the Capitoline Hill with the western slope of the Palatine Hill .
Ancient authorities state that the roots of a fig tree growing in this swamp caught and stopped the basket carrying Romulus and Remus as it floated along on the Tiber current .
The place therefore has a high symbolic significance .
Even after the Cloaca was built , the area was still prone to flooding from the Tiber , until the ground level was raised after the Neronian fire .
